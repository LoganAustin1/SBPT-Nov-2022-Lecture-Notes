    <p> HTML Definitions:</p> 
    <p> HTML: HighperText markup language. </p>
    <p> An HTML document is composed of elements and attributes</p>
    <P>elements and tags are the same thing</P>
    <p> Element: Building blocks of HTML that is also a node. Part of the HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document. HTML elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content.</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp" target="_blank">Elements Example</a>
    <p> Attributes: Provides additional information inside elements such as href and id. </p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp" target="_blank">Attributes Example</a>
    <p>HTML < style > element: Use the < style > element to apply a simple sheet to an HTML document. instead of having to create an entire ruleset if its just simple styles it can be done with < styles > </p>
    <p>a=anchor is a element and href is its attribute. This creates a hyperlink to web pages. the content within the a should indicate the links destination</p>
    <P> you can line break any element with < br > </P>
    <p>syntax: In HTML and CSS, syntax is the order in which elements appear or are written, meaning the grammar and spelling of the language. Syntax rules are in place to ensure the languages are always written in a way that can be read or interpreted by a computer. its writing code that the computer can understand. <br>
    <p>Emmets: these are the "shortscuts" or shorthand for writing code. instead of writing < p > < /p > for paragraph we can simply hit p and then the tab button</p>
    <p>parent/children elements: The parent is the div that hold all of the other divs inside of it. in css we can use the parent to tell ALL the divs or children inside it what to do.</p>

            examples of selectors include: <i>Class</i> which can be selected with a . <br>
            <i>id</i> which can be selected with a #
        <p>Ruletset: A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The selector(s), which in this example is h1, points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value. The rule set is the main building block of a CSS sheet. <br>
        h1 { <br>
            color: blue; <br>
            text-align: center; <br>  
            } <br>
